Spirit of the elders
asunder
wagon
follows feathers of hallowed dragon.
Mycorrhizae network rootlets, ipso facto, omnidirectional sharing. 
Decapitated ipso jure into omnirelational caring.
Lazarusian slight return to Icaros of omnifarious meaning.
Pretention surfing Hokusaiian laps of pareidolian patterns that aren’t figmentation.
The subtle and invisible fodder, subatomic, phylogeny-memento lapping cymatic animation, distilled spirit into static affectation,
nefarious prod,
taunting,
screaming for attention through quivering lips into an apathetic moist pillow. 
Birds up, pants down, unveiling a litany of illuminated stick and poke tattoos:
A basilica with the forked tongue, slit eyes, and jeweled crown of a basilisk;
A Kokopelli whose antennae morphed into a Naga;
“Heal Thyself” written in a ring RHCP-style around a half-caduceus half-Symbionese Liberation Army insignia;
a grin without a cat;
an inverted slain lamb hidden in a parallax portrait of a falling man wearing a do-rag;
an inverted winking eye with tongue stuck out;
an altar depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their three alien children, nucleic acid slithering asunder, reforged with black technology;
a Gothic squid that turns into a seven eyed seven horned goat when reflected in a ceiling mounted mirror;
“Non obliviscere Memento spectare” in a vaguely Etruscan or perhaps pizza joint bold font;
“Doremi Fasol Latido” in that same font;
a circular rainbow;
and the most recent self-inflicted masterpiece, still healing under cellophane and tape, “Ron Paul 2012” as an excision of the American flag.
	I made these things for you, Mr. Kleck. Only you have the patience and visionary pattern recognition software for a puzzle master’s apprenticeship. Involuntarily I made them for you, Jonathan. Can’t you help me figure out what they mean? You and I are the same person just with a different haircut. Why won’t you answer my messages?!?!
