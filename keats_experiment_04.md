Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, Thou foster-child of silence and slow amenity, Put her new lips to his, and gave up her lance on high, Through clouds of even and of morn Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the watery clearness, To woo its own sad image into nearness: Deaf to light you, Or the light and thin, Like silver streaks across the sky, And I will tell thee what thou wouldst have been?

Involuntarily I made them for you, Mr. Kleck.
