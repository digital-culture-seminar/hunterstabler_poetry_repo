Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity Makes this alarum in the argent revelry, With plume, tiara, and all the wonders of an ever-changing tale; The light dwelt o'er the hills; Let the mad poets say whate'er they please Of the sweets of song: The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, and clear, That men of cruel clay Cut Mercy with a mane richly flowing?

```

And can I e'er repay the friendly aids That smooth the path to die.
