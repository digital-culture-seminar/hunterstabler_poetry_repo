## Songs of mine
```
What is more soothing to me than these songs of mine?
```
```
Who shall his fame impair when thou art capable, As thou exceedest all things in thy silent mind?
Unbounded knowledge makes a God as wrathful as himself.
Thou hath smelteth surely dealteth
unholy effervescent vespers of the swine
```
```
Redolent of sulfur twine
round esters offside apothecary shelf
tremors imbibe
a crescent indigo swill
```
```
calming ghostly pipes
monotrope amethyst sleep
orbs blink and soften
Esper's crystal eye.
```
```
A pauper's coffin
from billowy vagueness shies
```
```
Unravish'd bride of quietness,
Thou foster-child of silence
and slowly animated through clouds of divinorum
and of morn float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the quartz clearness,
to woo its own sad image into nearness:
Death to light you, or mourn the light of death to show you,
beryl fissure leaks like thin silver streaks across the sky,
And I will tell thee what thou wouldst have been?
```
```
Nay, a blackest shape
reconciled internally
```
```
horselike tourmaline
```
```
Knowing now each piece
```
```
Not waiting until after to learn what it has to teach
```
```
For what a height my spirit leaps, and prances,
E'en then my soul with exultation dances
for that finality from outside perspective glances.
```
```
Shut up senses, telesthesiastic gyres
wait in the stillness.
Finally from inside perspective smote
reckoning the yet to occur illness
```
```
a rattling that unhinged the mind from time
```
```
What bezel lens through the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in those meads where sometimes secrets to the puzzle finds
```
```
endgame buzzer ringing tines
```
```
echoes in a compound eye
```
```
O let me taste that sweet sound once more,
the thought after thought to nourish uphill gyroscopic spires
trickle down from cathedral vaulting antipodal pole of the hivemind
```
```
involuntarily
```
